# Variant Launch Aframe example
How to use the Variant Launch SDK with Aframe. Adapted from the example at [https://glitch.com/edit/#!/xr-spinosaurus?path=index.html:1:0](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/xr-spinosaurus?path=index.html:1:0). Note iOS Launch viewer will only work with a [valid SSL certificate](https://launch.variant3d.com/docs/development-guide)


## Installation

 1. Clone or download this github repo
 2. Add your SDK key in each example HTML file. Search for `YOUR_SDK_KEY` to find the initialisation calls that require your key.
 3. Upload the project to a server with SSL (where the url begins with `https://`).
